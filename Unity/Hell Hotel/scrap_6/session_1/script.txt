Hello and welcome back to another Hell Hotel devlog.

In this video we will show you how we upgraded the look of our world.

Firstly, Andrew worked on making a better elevator.

This was a massive upgrade because it ment ther were buttons that Andrew could add functionality to.

It's alwase better to upgrade your elevator modle from something with a literal refrigerator texture to something better with seperated parts to be animated.

In the background you can see the opening and closing animations for the new elevator design.

Keep in mind even though this is a big elevator revamp it is still not finished and may change in the future.

Next, Andrew worked on a model for the main entrance big door at the front of the hotel.

You can see a comparison between a normal room door, to the new main entrance door.

Lastly, the world has been worked on by David, you can see his work in the background.
